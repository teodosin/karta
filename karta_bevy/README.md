At first startup, you will be asked to choose a folder to create your vault in. Once set up, the contents of that folder will be spawned in as a force-directed graph. Middle-mouse click to pan the view and scroll to zoom. Dragging from the edge of a node to another will create a new connection between those nodes. Right-clicking on a node will bring up a menu where you can pin and unpin nodes (to be ignored by the force simulation) and move to another nodes' context.
