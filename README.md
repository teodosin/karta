# Karta

Karta is a graph creation and visualisation environment. Most fundamentally it is intended to augment file browsers and allow for visual and conceptual connections to be made between files in the file system. This makes it potentially a great tool for file and project management, as a sort of in-between layer between other, more specialised software. It would allow compositing and packaging up of some files and data to sequence them into new files. For example, exporting a sequence of image nodes into pdf's or videos. This would provide a great base set of functionality from which Karta can then be specialised into different use cases depending on what there is demand for.

Karta is a Godot4 project. As such, it is written in Godot's internal scripting language, GDScript. If and when Karta modules need performance boosts, the preferred direction is for them to be rewritten as Rust modules. It is possible for the entirety of Karta to eventually be rewritten in Rust, if that is needed and there is funding from an income stream. Rust is preferred over C++ because of its developer experience and memory safety. The latter is quite important for a software that is heavy on data manipulation. 

The main variable for the future direction and scope of the project is whether Karta turns out to be a viable SaaS company. If not, then it will be only an internal tool for Teodosin and will be developed with excess time and profits from main Teodosin services and income. If yes, then effort will have to be made to improve the user experience and to develop Karta as a company.

Karta will in any event be used as an internal tool for Teodosin creative productions. It started as a passion project and should remain so. Even if a commercial direction is taken, the fun but not necessarily needed features will remain in the program as hidden easter eggs. In addition to file and project management, it has potential as an audiovisual coding environment, as an animation and motion design suite, a data visualisation tool, an AI interaction layer and of course, as an extension to Godot Engine for making games. In the event of a complete Rust rewrite, Karta could be built on top of and serve as an editor for Bevy Engine. 


### ROADMAP
 
##### SPRING/SUMMER 2023
MVP Version, available for alpha testing. The first big milestone, after which the software is incrementally given to designers and artists for testing and feedback. This is where iteration can begin and possible directions for Karta can be determined. Does it have potential as a commercial tool? How does the rapid development of AI impact its viability?

##### AUTUMN 2023/SPRING 2024
Viktor develops Karta part-time as part of his master's thesis. Iteration continues. Commercial viability begins to be determined. 

##### SUMMER 2024
Viktor graduates. Karta keeps being developed either as a side project, or full-time by Viktor if commercial viability is established and the project can financially support at least 1 person.
