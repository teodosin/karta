# Karta

Karta is a graph creation and visualisation environment. Most fundamentally it is intended to augment file browsers and allow for visual and conceptual connections to be made between files in the file system. Right now it is highly unstable and experimental, with only the barest foundations set in place. Not recommended for use.
