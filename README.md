# Karta


Karta is a graph creation and visualisation environment. Most fundamentally it is intended to augment file browsers and allow for visual and conceptual connections to be made between files in the file system. This makes it potentially a great tool for file and project management, as a sort of in-between layer between other, more specialised software. It would allow compositing and packaging up of some files and data to sequence them into new files. For example, exporting a sequence of image nodes into pdf's or videos. This would provide a great base set of functionality from which Karta can then be specialised into different use cases depending on what there is demand for.


Karta is a graph creation and visualisation environment. Most fundamentally it is intended to augment file browsers and allow for visual and conceptual connections to be made between files in the file system. Right now it is highly unstable and experimental, with only the barest foundations set in place. Not recommended for use.
