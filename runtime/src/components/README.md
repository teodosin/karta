Components for the MIT runtime.

This folder will host purely-view components intended for embedding in websites/apps without editor functionality. Editor-specific composition will live in GPL editor packages and will consume these components without subclassing.

Planned:
- RuntimeViewport.svelte (read-only viewport)
- Lightweight node renderers (read-only)
